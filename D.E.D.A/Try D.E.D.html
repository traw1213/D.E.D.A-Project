            <h4>About D.E.D.A:  Bringing Awarness through Sensory Integration Therapy.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Colors: Chromotherapy or Color Therapy - This therapy believes that colors can influence our emotions and well-being. Different colors are said to evoke different responses in people.</li>
                <li>Sequences: This could refer to a structured or systematic approach to therapy, where sequences or patterns are used to evoke certain responses or behaviors.</li>
                <li>Sounds: Sound Therapy or Music Therapy - This involves the use of music or specific sounds to improve health or functional outcomes. It can evoke memories, emotions, and even physical responses.</li>
                <li> Bibliotherapy - This is the use of reading materials recommended by therapists to help clients understand and solve their problems. Reading can offer insights, promote self-awareness, and provide comfort. It can be a way for individuals to recognize their own experiences and feelings in the narratives of others, leading to a sense of validation and understanding. Bibliotherapy can be used in conjunction with traditional talk therapy or as a standalone approach, depending on the individual's needs and the therapist's recommendations.</li>
                <li>Frequencies: Binaural Beats or Brainwave Entrainment - This is a method where sounds of two different frequencies are played in each ear, and the brain perceives a third tone that is the mathematical difference between the two. It's believed to enhance relaxation, meditation, stress reduction, pain management, improved sleep, and even improved learning.</li>
